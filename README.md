# temperature-converter
Asks user to enter a temperature range and interval. Displays the temperature in celsius and fahrenheit from the lowest temperature to the highest incrementing by the interval entered by the user.
Requirements:
1. Take three arguments:
	+ A start temperature (in celsius)
	+ An end temperature (in celsius)
	+ A step size
2. Print out a table that goes from the start temperature to the end temperature 
incrementing by the step size. Do this for both celsius and fahrenheit.

Constrainsts:
1. Input temperature should not be lower than given limit.
2. Input temperature should not be higher than a given limit.
3. Step size should be less than the difference between the lowest and highest 
temperature.
